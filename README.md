# emcc-lldl-poc

This is a POC based on what is described in [Load-time Dynamic Linking](https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Dynamic-Linking.html?highlight=static%20linking#load-time-dynamic-linking) of the [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) docs.
It splits the entire project into more than one WASM modules and links them at load time.
Also include a sample makefile to show how to build the project by applying the tips described in the section [Code Size](https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Dynamic-Linking.html?highlight=static%20linking#code-size).
